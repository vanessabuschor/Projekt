 All that I'm living for,
All that I'm dying for,
All that I can't ignore alone at night.

I can feel the night beginning.
Separate me from the living.
Understanding me,
After all I've seen.
Piecing every thought together,
Find the words to make me better.
If I only knew how to pull myself apart.

All that I'm living for,
All that I'm dying for,
All that I can't ignore alone at night.
All that I'm wanted for,
Although I wanted more.
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me.

I believe that dreams are sacred.
Take my darkest fears and play them
Like a lullaby,
Like a reason why,
Like a play of my obsessions,
Make me understand the lesson,
So I'll find myself,
So I won't be lost again.

All that I'm living for,
All that I'm dying for,
All that I can't ignore alone at night.
All that I'm wanted for,
Although I wanted more.
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me.

Guess I thought I'd have to change the world to make you see me,
To be the one.
I could have run forever,
But how far would I have come
Without mourning your love?

All that I'm living for,
All that I'm dying for,
All that I can't ignore alone at night.
All that I'm wanted for,
Although I wanted more.
Lock the last open door, my ghosts are gaining on me.

Should it hurt to love you?
Should I feel like I do?
Should I lock the last open door,
My ghosts are gaining on me.You are everything I need to see
Smile and sunlight makes sunlight to me
Laugh and come and look into me
Drips of moonlight washing over me
Can I show you what you want from me

Angel of mine, can I thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel, I must confess
It's you that always gives me strength
And I don't know where I'd be without you

After all these years, one thing is true
Constant force within my heart is you
You touch me, I feel I'm moving into you
I treasure every day I spend with you
All the things I am come down to you

Angel of mine
Let me thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel, I must confess
It's you that always gives me strength
And I don't know where I'd be without you

Back in the arms of my angel
Back to the peace that I so love
Back in the arms of my angel I can finally rest
Giving you a gift that you remind me

Angel of mine
Let me thank you
You have saved me time and time and time and time again
Angel, I must confess
It's you that always gives me strength
And I don't know where I'd be without you

Angel of mine
Can I thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel, I must confess
It's you that always gives me strength
And I don't know where I'd be without you
... Without youI'd give anything to give me to you
Can you forget the world that you thought you knew

If you want me
Come and find me
Nothing's stopping you so please release me

I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for you

Nothing left to make me feel anymore
There's only you and everyday I need more

If you want me
Come and find me
I'll do anything you say, just tell me

I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for you
I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for you
Anything for you

Overcome your urge inside
Forever never die
I'll be everything you need

I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for you
I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for youDear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me
And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free
I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you
And at sweet night, you are my own
Take my hand

We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning's light
We'll be halfway to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name

I have dreamt of a place for you and I
No one knows who we are there
All I want is to give my life only to you
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore
Let's run away, I'll take you there

We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning's light
We'll be halfway to anywhere
Where no one needs a reason

Forget this life
Come with me
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart
Drop your guard
No one's left to stop you

Forget this life
Come with me
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart
Drop your guard
No one's left to stop you now

We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning's light
We'll be halfway to anywhere
Where love is more than just your nameMeet me after dark again and I'll hold you
I am nothing more than to see you there

[Chorus:]
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

If only night can hold you where I can see you, my love
Then let me never ever wake again

[Chorus:]
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

[Bridge:]
Somehow I know that we can't wake again from this dream
It's not real, but it's ours

[Chorus:]
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

[Chanting]

[Music Fades Out]How can I pretend that I don't see,
What you hide so carelesslly,
I saw her bleed,
And you heard me breathe,
And I froze inside myself,
And turned away,
I must be dreaming

We all live, we all die,
That does not begin to justify you

It's not what it seems,
Not what you think,
No, I must be dreaming,
It's only in my mind,
Not real life,
No, I must be dreaming

Help you know I've got to tell someone,
Tell them what I know you've done,
I fear you, but spoken fears can come true

We all live, we all die,
That does not begin to justify you

It's not what it seems,
Not what you think,
No I must be dreaming,
It's only in my mind,
Not real life,
No I must be dreaming

We all live,
We all die,
That does not begin to justify you

It's not what it seems,
Not what you think,
No I must be dreaming,
It's only in my mind,
Not real life,
No I must be dreaming

Not what it seems,
Not what you think,
I must be dreaming,
Just in my mind,
Not real life,
I must be dreaming.I've been looking in the mirror for so long,
That I've come to believe my souls on the other side.
All the little pieces falling shattered.
Shards of me too sharp to put back together.
Too small to matter,
But big enough to cut me in to so many little pieces if I try to touch her.

And I bleed. I bleed.
And I breathe. I breathe, no more

I take a breath and I try draw from my spirit's well.
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child.
Lie to me convince me that I've been sick forever.
And all of this will make sense when I get better.
But I know the difference between myself and my reflection.
I just can't help but to wonder which of us do you love.

So I bleed. I bleed.
And I breathe.
I breathe no,
Bleed. I bleed.
And I breathe. I breathe. I breathe. I breathe, no more.

[piano solo ending]How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb
Without a soul
My spirit sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and
Lead it back home

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I Can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(I Can't wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me, breathe
Into me and make me real
Bring me to life

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I Can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(I Can't wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life

Frozen (frozen) inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only (only) you are the life among the dead

All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought without a voice without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I Can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(I Can't wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

(Bring me to life)
I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
(Bring me)
(Bring me to life)Seether:
I wanted you to know that
I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away...
I keep your photograph and
I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

You've gone away, you don't feel me here, anymore

Amy Lee:
The worst is over now
And we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn
And no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away...

Cause I'm Broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone...
You gone away, you don't feel me here anymoreDon't cry to me.
If you loved me,
You would be here with me.
You want me,
Come find me.

Sick with shame.
Must be exhausting to lose your own game.
Selfishly hated,
No wonder you're jaded.
You can't play the victim this time,
And you're too late.

So Don't cry to me.
If you loved me,
You would be here with me.
You want me,
Come find me.
Make up your mind.

You never call me when you're sober.
You only want it cause it's over,
It's over.

How could I have burned paradise?
How could I - you were never mine.

So don't cry to me.
If you loved me,
You would be here with me.
Don't lie to me,
Just get your things.
I've made up your mind.Hi I'm Robby's sister, I guess that's plain to see
When we watch cartoon cartoons, I'm happy as can be
I think samurai Jack is cool, And Dexter's laboratory
I miss watching power puff, I miss watching T. V.

Well livin' the tour bus ain't that bad
But I feel like I lost all that, I have

On Cartoon Network, I miss you so
On Cartoon Network, where did you go
Grim and evil, how I love that little brain
Johnny Bravo, can I smack you once again?

I hope you've learned a lesson here
Treasure what you have, don't make the mistake I made
The rockstar life is sad

Well, livin' on the tour bus is, pretty bad
And now I'm sure I know, the meanin' in my life
The love within my soul
The reason I wake up each day, and it's:

Cartoon Network, I miss you so
My Cartoon Network, where did you go
My Cartoon NetworkIf you want to live, let live
If you want to go, let go
I'm not afraid to dream- to sleep, sleep forever
I don't need to touch the sky
I just want to feel that high
And you refuse to lift me

Guess it wasn't real after all
Guess it wasn't real all along
If I fall and all is lost
It's where I belong

If you want to live, let live
If you want to go, let go
I'm never gonna be your sweet, sweet surrender

Guess it wasn't real after all
Guess it wasn't real all along

If I fall and all is lost
No light to lead the way
Remember that all alone
Is where I belong

In a dream
Will you give your love to me
Beg my broken heart to beat
Save my life
Change my mind

If I fall and all is lost
No light to lead the way
Remember that all alone
Is where I belong

In a dream,
Will you give your love to me?
Beg my broken heart to beat,
Save my life, change my mind.

If I fall and all is lost.
No light to lead the way.
Remember that all alone is where I belong
